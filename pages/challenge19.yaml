    Like most high security research facilities, many of the rooms in the
    Cushing and Fitzpatrick require a secret number code to enter.  Usually, a
    single passcode is given to all the users of a particular room.
    Unfortunately, in this day and age of camera phones and drones, it is easy
    for intruders to snoop on people entering in the passcode [^1].

    In an effort to thwart passcode snoopers, the building security team has
    implemented a new passcode mechanism: instead of entering the whole passcode,
    the user must enter in three random numbers from the original door code. For
    instance, if the passcode was `2468135`, the user may be asked to enter in the
    `2nd`, `4th`, and `5th` numbers: `481`.  This shorter sequence (`2nd`, `4th`,
    `5th`) changes each time, so just watching the someone enter in the door code
    will not guarantee entry to the snooper.  Moreover, it helps prevent divulging
    the complete passcode.

    Being the [black hat] that you are, however, you decide that this security
    arrangement is weak and plan on cracking the code to the instructor's
    office [^2]. To do so, you have carefully monitored a series of successful
    entries and recorded them in a text file. Knowing that the three random
    numbers are always asked for in order and that the digits in the passcode
    are unique (due to limitations to the security software), your next step is
    to analyze these entries and produce the original passcode.

    [^1]:           Or people just text it to everyone or write it on the whiteboard.
    [^2]:           Because like my door is never open and stuff.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of successful entries where each entry is a
    three digit sequence:

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        352
        154
        542
        315
        152

    ## Output

    The passcode for the above input is:

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        31542

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="background-color: white" markdown="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>**Time Complexity**</td>
          <td>`O(VlogV)`, where `V` is the number of digits in the passcode.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>**Space Complexity**</td>
          <td>`O(V)`, where `V` is the number of digits in the passcode.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 01]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-34872-su21-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git checkout master                       # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git checkout -b challenge19               # Create and checkout challenge19 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge19/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge19/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
        $ git commit -m "challenge19: done"         # Commit your changes

        $ git push -u origin challenge19            # Send changes to GitHub

    To check your code, you can use the `.scripts/check.py` script or [curl]:

        :::bash
        $ .scripts/check.py
        Checking challenge19 program.cpp ...
          Result Success
            Time 0.02
           Score 6.00 / 6.00

        $ curl -F source=@challenge19/program.cpp https://dredd.h4x0r.space/code/cse-34872-su21/challenge19
        {"result": "Success", "score": 6, "time": 0.03195953369140625, "value": 6, "status": 0}

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Pull Request

    Once you have commited your work and pushed it to [GitHub], remember to
    create a **pull request** and assign it to the **teaching assistant**.
