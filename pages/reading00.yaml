    **Everyone**:

    Welcome to [CSE 34872 Programming Challenges], which (as the syllabus
    states) is a "course that revolves around solving *brain-teaser* and
    *puzzle-type* problems that often appear in programming contests, online
    challenges, and job interviews".  What this means is that we will be
    studying common data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques
    that are useful in tackling a variety of problems.

    #### <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> TL;DR

    For this week, you familiarize yourself with using [Zoom] and [Slack] and
    then setup your [GitHub] assignments repository.

    ## Course Overview

    Last semester, many of you took the **Data Structures** course where you
    learned about the properties and characteristics of different data
    structures (*and perhaps you even implemented a few*).  The focus of this
    class, however, is not in the *construction* of these data structures, but
    rather their *application*.  This means we will focus on *when* to use
    these data structures and algorithms and *how* to utilize them effectively
    rather than *what* they are.  In concrete terms, we will not be
    implementing say a [hash table]; instead we will use one to solve a variety
    of problems.

    Following the [Hands-On Imperative], you will have the opportunity to put
    the material we discuss in class into practice via a *respectful* number of
    weekly **programming challenges** (**three a week**).  Along with these
    challenges will be **reading assignments** to ensure you have a context or
    background knowledge for what we will be discussing in class.  As with last
    semester in [Systems Programming], the reading assignments will be
    automatically graded.

    In fact all of your assignments will be automatically graded by [dredd] via
    the [continuous integration] system provided by [GitHub].  As you may be
    realizing during your internship this summer, **testing** is an important
    part of software engineering and we will therefore explore various aspects
    of **software development** including debugging, profiling, testing, and
    more throughout the course (*if there is time*).

    Although each class will involve some amount of lecture, there will also be
    a lot of in-class activities and hands-on learning.  Because of this,
    **participation** is a component of your grade and you are expected to come
    to class **regularly** and **on-time**.

    Fortunately, however, there are **no exams** in this class.  Instead, we
    will have a final **in-class programming contest** where you will get to
    work in groups of `3` (similar to the [ACM Programming Contest]).
    Likewise, you will also have to participate in **two external programming
    contests** such as those provided by [HackerRank] or [LeetCode].

    ## Task 1: Zoom

    For all of our class meetings, we will be using [Zoom] to video conference.
    Before our first class meeting, make sure you can login to the [Zoom]
    system and access our [meeting link]:

    > [https://notredame.zoom.us/j/96051200559](https://notredame.zoom.us/j/96051200559)

    ### Notes

    - You will need to signup and create a [Zoom] account if you don't already
      have one.  We recommend that you use the Notre Dame [Zoom] login system.

    - You will need to download and install the [Zoom] client to perform video
      conferencing.

    - By default, you microphone will be **muted**.  To speak, you will need to
      manually unmute it.

    ## Task 2: Slack

    For communication outside of our meeting time, we will be using [Slack],
    specifically the `#cse-34872-su21` channel:

    > [https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-34872-su21/](https://nd-cse.slack.com/messages/cse-34872-su21/)

    There is a [class mailing list], but most day-to-day communication
    (including office hours and homework help) should take place on [Slack].

    [class mailing list]: su21-cse-34872-01-group@nd.edu

    ### Notes

    - You will need to signup and create a [Slack] account if you don't already
      have one.

    - You can use the web interface or download the [Slack] desktop client
      (there are also mobile applications as well).

    - Feel free to join any other channels that may interest you.

    ## Task 3: GitHub

    All of your work will be submitted to [GitHub] using [git]. Your final task
    is to setup your [GitHub] repository by doing the following:

    1. **Sign-in** or **create** a [GitHub] account if you do not already have one.

    2. **Fork** the class assignments repository from the following template:

        > [https://classroom.github.com/a/UaSJmI9j](https://classroom.github.com/a/UaSJmI9j)

        This will create a **private** `cse-34872-su21-assignments-$USERNAME`
        repository under your own account and linked to the [nd-cse-34872-su21]
        organization.

    3. Once this is done, you can [clone] your [git] repository to your local
    machine (or the **student** machines:

            :::bash
            $ git clone https://github.com/nd-cse-34872-su21/cse-34872-su21-assignments-$USERNAME.git

        Please update the `README.md` file to include your **name** and
        **NetID** so it is straightforward to identify your account.

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: If you have not done so already, you should consider setting
        up [SSH Keys] on [GitHub] to enable password-less pushing and pulling.
        </div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub Repository

    You are responsible for ensuring that your [GitHub] assignments repository
    is in proper order, which means you have the correct settings and
    permissions set.  Failure to properly configure your repository will
    adversely impact your grade.
